## Introduction / Background

**Clinical trials** are a type of research that studies new tests and treatments and evaluates their effects on human health outcomes. Enrolling in a clinical trial can be extremely beneficial for both patients with chronic conditions and healthy volunteers.

> “For those suffering from a chronic condition, enrolling in a clinical trial may offer options that might be unavailable otherwise and it also presents an opportunity to have access to top notch medical care as well as being a unique way of contributing to the advancement of medical knowledge. For healthy volunteers, knowing that others may benefit from their efforts can be very rewarding, and participating in clinical research can sometimes uncover health problems that people are not aware of.” 
> ~ Tesheia Johnson, executive director of the Yale Center for Clinical Investigation

Unfortunately, the challenges in clinical trials usually aren’t discussed as much as the results themselves. One of the biggest challenges is faced just before starting clinical trials: patient recruitment. Around 80% of these studies are either halted or even closed due to low patient recruitment (https://www.clinicaltrialsarena.com/features/featureclinical-trial-patient-recruitment/). One reason for this is the specific requirements of the trial. Each disease area has a unique patient base for clinical trials, and finding the right patients is often a huge challenge.

Moreover, NIH focus groups in 2011 found that many members of the general public lacked familiarity with clinical trials and were unaware of opportunities for participation by healthy volunteers. This lack of awareness has certainly been a contributing factor to the fact that only 4% of Americans have ever been involved in a clinical trial.

## Examples

Here are a few examples of Alembic out in the wild being used in a variety of ways:

### As a Jekyll theme

1. Add `gem "alembic-jekyll-theme"` to your `Gemfile` to add the theme as a dependancy
2. Run the command `bundle install` in the root of project to install the theme and its dependancies
3. Add `theme: alembic-jekyll-theme` to your `_config.yml` file to set the site theme
4. Run `bundle exec jekyll serve` to build and serve your site
5. Done! Use the [configuration](#configuration) documentation and the example [`_config.yml`](https://github.com/daviddarnes/alembic/blob/master/_config.yml) file to set things like the navigation, contact form and social sharing buttons

### As a GitHub Pages remote theme

1. Add `gem "jekyll-remote-theme"` to your `Gemfile` to add the theme as a dependancy
2. Run the command `bundle install` in the root of project to install the jekyll remote theme gem as a dependancy
3. Add `jekyll-remote-theme` to the list of `plugins` in your `_config.yml` file
4. Add `remote_theme: daviddarnes/alembic@main` to your `_config.yml` file to set the site theme
5. Run `bundle exec jekyll serve` to build and serve your site
6. Done! Use the [configuration](#configuration) documentation and the example [`_config.yml`](https://github.com/daviddarnes/alembic/blob/master/_config.yml) file to set things like the navigation, contact form and social sharing buttons

### As a Boilerplate / Fork

_(deprecated, not recommended)_

1. [Fork the repo](https://github.com/daviddarnes/alembic#fork-destination-box)
2. Replace the `Gemfile` with one stating all the gems used in your project
3. Delete the following unnecessary files/folders: `.github`, `LICENSE`, `screenshot.png`, `CNAME` and `alembic-jekyll-theme.gemspec`
4. Run the command `bundle install` in the root of project to install the jekyll remote theme gem as a dependancy
5. Run `bundle exec jekyll serve` to build and serve your site
6. Done! Use the [configuration](#configuration) documentation and the example [`_config.yml`](https://github.com/daviddarnes/alembic/blob/master/_config.yml) file to set things like the navigation, contact form and social sharing buttons

## Customising

When using Alembic as a theme means you can take advantage of the file overriding method. This allows you to overwrite any file in this theme with your own custom file, by matching the file name and path. The most common example of this would be if you want to add your own styles or change the core style settings.

To add your own styles copy the [`styles.scss`](https://github.com/daviddarnes/alembic/blob/master/assets/styles.scss) into your own project with the same file path (`assets/styles.scss`). From there you can add your own styles, you can even optionally ignore the theme styles by removing the `@import "alembic";` line.

If you're looking to set your own colours and fonts you can overwrite them by matching the variable names from the [`_settings.scss`](https://github.com/daviddarnes/alembic/blob/master/_sass/_settings.scss) file in your own `styles.scss`, make sure to state them before the `@import "alembic";` line so they take effect. The settings are a mixture of custom variables and settings from [Sassline](https://medium.com/@jakegiltsoff/sassline-v2-0-e424b2881e7e) - follow the link to find out how to configure the typographic settings.
